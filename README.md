# Hindi_Sentiment_FineTuning_bert_ML


📌 Project Overview
The goal is to classify sentiment in Hindi user reviews. The workflow includes:

Loading and preprocessing the dataset.

Tokenizing Hindi text for transformer compatibility.

Fine-tuning a pre-trained model (e.g., bert-base-multilingual-cased or Indic-specific models).

Evaluating performance with metrics such as accuracy and F1-score.

🧠 Model & Dataset
Model: You can use any transformer-based model like mBERT, IndicBERT, or mT5 depending on your use case.

Dataset: The IndicSentiment dataset's Hindi split is used.
